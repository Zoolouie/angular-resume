      <p> It's only deep in the trenches of css that you realize you should have just cut your losses and instead made a WordPress
        application. I saw somewhere an absolute madperson was creating art peices with only css style rules. I don't know how
        insane you have to be, but I have some mad respect. Props to you wherever you are, css man.
