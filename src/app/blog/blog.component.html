    <h2>10/20/2019</h2>
    <p> I finished my project and am really excited about it! I think I made a really good mix between humor and seriousness.

    <h1> Motion Infographic Demo </h1>
    <h2>10/17/2019</h2>
    <p> I'm done with a great amount of the base work that needed to be done. The voice recordings and all the 
      necessary assets are made, I just need to go through some work putting it all together. Two of the major 
      parts are completed so far, you can check it out at  <a href="https://youtu.be/V1ucMIWWbZw">this </a> link.

    <p> I created a short writup as well as a storyboard for my project on the dangerous, hideous freshwater snail.

    <p> I made a dancing rotoscope dog! It's pretty neat and runs at 15 fps. Here's the

    <h2>10/1/2019</h2>
    <p> Even just making some people walk takes so much work to do it right. Thankfully we were assigned silly walks!
      If you have some sort of morbid curiousity to see a dapper man walk silly, here's the

    <h1>I've Never Suffered Like This Before</h1>
    <h2>9/22/2019</h2>
    <p> My Kinetic Typography project is finally done, and I never thought I would grow so sick of hearing the same phrase over and over again.
      Regardless, I'm pretty happy with the result and without further ado here it

    <h1>A Lesson in Moving Text</h1>
    <h2>9/18/2019</h2>
    <p> Wow making words move takes a lot of time! Right now I'm focused on getting every word
      I need organized. I have 10 seconds - 25 seconds mapped out. It definitely needs some timing and 
      alignment work but it's definitely there. I'm pretty pumped to jam it out over the weekend
      when I have more freetime :). Here's a link to the unfinished

    <h1>A Look Into My Perfect Art</h1>
    <h2>9/15/2019</h2>
    <p> Two things at once! Oh me oh my! I created a storyboard and a basic outline for the Kinetic Typography project I made.
      I'm really glad that I have a little bit of storyboarding experience from Human Computer Interaction, but it definitely
      wasn't a deep dive. For those of you crazy cats still reading around, here's the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rowjxSH2z53YEX0blp8FBTRGExMRCJy_Vk_gjFs1uyA/edit?usp=sharing">brief</a> and here's the

    <h1>Personal Animated Banner</h1>
    <h2>9/9/2019</h2>
    <p> I got the chance to work on a personal logo for myself over the weekend. I'm really blown away by the amount of
      power that
      after effects gives you. I was able to spin up something reasonably professionally looking in a suprisingly short
      amount of time. I got
      a little carried away and made it 4 seconds over the suggested time. It was a really cool learning experience
      doing the typing effects.
      Anyway, without further ado, I present to you my

    <h1>Humble Beginnings</h1>
    <h2>9/3/2019</h2>
    <p> It's only deep in the trenches of css that you realize you should have just cut your losses and instead made a
      WordPress
      application. I saw somewhere an absolute madperson was creating art peices with only css style rules. I don't
      know how
      insane you have to be, but I have some mad respect. Props to you wherever you are, css man.
